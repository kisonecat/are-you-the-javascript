# Are You The JavaScript?

Interactively run through scenarios for the reality show "Are You The One?"

# Demo

Visit [areyouthe.xyz](http://areyouthe.xyz/) to try it.  Probably Chrome or Firefox should be used.

# Acknowledgements

I very much enjoyed the [Are You The One? Math](http://areuthe.blogspot.com/) blog, and credit that blog as inspiring this weekend project.

# Running

Clone the repository, then run `npm install` and `bower update`.  Then to explore scenarios, you can open `index.html` in your favorite browser (perhaps after running something like [asdf](https://github.com/ddfreyne/adsf/) to serve the files).
